## Answers to Questions
1. the connections between the class -
- AsciiArtAlgorithm -
A class in the ascii_art package responsible for running the AsciiArt art algorithm.
Utilizes composition with classes from the image package and the image_char_matching package.

- Shell -
The main class who runs the program.
Handle the user input, executes the AsciiArtAlgo using composition, and manage the output.

- Memento -
An inner class of Shell.
Responsible for saving the last BrightnessMatrix to avoid "expensive" recalculating when not needed.
Using composition with the BrightnessMatrix class.

- BrightnessMatrix -
Responsible for creating a matrix of double values that represent the brightness levels of
the pixels in the asciiArt image in the requested resolution.

- Image -
Represent an image as a matrix of Colors.
Handles operations and features related to this matrix.

- ImageProcessor -
A utility class for processing images.
Includes functionalities like padding the image with white pixels and other operations.

- SubImgCharMatcher -
A utility class responsible for mapping characters to brightness values.

2. Collections:
- AsciiArtAlgorithm  - ArrayList (BrightnessMatrices) - we used this data structure because we needed a
structure with efficient "add" and "get", while we only needed the last object in the array - in this case
both actions available in O(1).
- SubImgMatcher - Hashtable(Map) 1 - MAAYAN
- SubImgMatcher - Hashtable(Map) 2 - MAAYAN
- shell - sortedSet - MAAYAN

3. Exceptions - ROTEM
- User input errors:
We create InputExceptions who inheritance RunTimeExceptions and get a message parameter.
When the input was invalid we threw this exceptions and catch them in the "run" methods, where we printed the
relevant message and return back to getting an input from the user.
We also added ImageProcessor and SubImgCharMatcher exceptions, which are only relevant to the programmer
and help finding the problem at the first place possible. We threw those exceptions on the relevant places
and catch them in the "run" method, and exit the program there, making sure that wrong actions aren't being made.

4. SubImgCharMatcher API changes: - MAAYAN
We added the setRoundMethod method to the API (public) to give users the ability to control how brightness
calculations are rounded during the ASCII art generation process. Making this method public ensures
flexibility, allowing users to dynamically change the rounding behavior (ABS, UP, or DOWN) based on their
preferences or specific use cases without modifying the underlying code

5. API changes in the supplied files:
 we didn't change them
